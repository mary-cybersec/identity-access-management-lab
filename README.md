## 🔐 Task 1: Enable Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

### ✅ Objective
Enable Just-in-Time (JIT) elevation using Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for:
- Exchange Administrator
- Teams Administrator
- Security Administrator

This minimizes standing admin privileges and reduces risk of privilege abuse.

### 🛠️ Steps Taken
1. Logged in to [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
2. Navigated to **Privileged Identity Management > Microsoft Entra roles**
3. Enabled PIM for selected roles
4. Assigned user as **Eligible** (not Active) with **Permanent** assignment

### 🔎 Key Concepts
- **JIT Access** – Grant roles only when needed
- **Eligible** – Requires user to request access
- **PIM** – Provides access control, auditability, and time limits
